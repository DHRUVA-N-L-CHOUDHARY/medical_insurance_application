# Decentralized AI for Medical Diagnostics

## Overview
The Decentralized AI for Medical Diagnostics project aims to improve the efficiency and transparency of medical diagnostics through blockchain technology. By leveraging Ethereum blockchain, Metamask for wallet management, and Hardhat for smart contract development, the project enhances data security and accountability in medical insurance claims.

## Features
- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes Ethereum blockchain for transparent ledger and smart contract implementations.
- **Multi-User Application**: Built with Flutter for a responsive frontend, Node.js for backend services, and MongoDB for data storage.
- **Secure Transactions**: Ensures secure and tamper-proof transactions using Metamask for wallet interactions and Hardhat for smart contract deployment.
- **Enhanced Accountability**: Facilitates interaction among hospitals, patients, and insurance companies with transparent data sharing and verification.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter, Dart
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Metamask, Hardhat
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Other Tools**: AWS (for deployment and scalability)
